# CoCoS: Contrastive Context Sharing

This is the code repository of AAAI2022 paper 'CoCoS: Enhancing Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs with Unlabeled Data via Contrastive Context Sharing'.

The code is under preparation. The scripts in the current repo may not run properly.

## Progress
- [x] the entrance run script for results reproduction
- [x] the main program for one experiment (only for small datasets, such as Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed)
- [x] data preparation script/ data preprocessing program
- [x] trainers for each model (only for small datasets, such as Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed)
- [ ] other utilizations
- [ ] Clean up

## Requirements

- DGL v0.6 (or newer versions)
- PyTorch v1.6 (or newer versions, but v1.10. There are some issues on v1.10 when loading the graph dataset.)
